# Key Features

Having created the website from scratch, I learned how to create and implement features that I'm likely to use in my future websites over and over again. Here are some of the key features and topics that I worked on:

- Hamburger menu that appears on tablet-sized screens and smaller
- Smooth scrolling whenever any navigation (header and footer) are clicked
- Subtle animations that trigger when a certain viewport rule is met (e.g. element is in viewport or element is not in viewport) using `IntersectionObserver`
- Added cross-broswer support for certain CSS styles using prefixes (`-webkit`, `-moz-`, `-o-`, `-ms-`)
- Tested website on different browsers & had to style the `select` input so that it appears the same on all(Not really) browsers/devices
- Functional form ðŸ“§
- Fully responsive in all devices âœ¨
- Utilized grid, flexbox and absolute positioning
